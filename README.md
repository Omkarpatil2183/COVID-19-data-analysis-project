# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 data using Python. It computes metrics like active cases, recovered cases, and death rates, and visualizes trends over time using graphs and charts.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and creates new metrics.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculates:
  - Active cases
  - Recovered cases
  - Death rates
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots like:
  - Time series for confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases.
  - Comparisons between trends.

## Files
- `analysis.py`: The Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- `covid_data.csv`: The input dataset with raw COVID-19 data.
- `cleaned_covid_data.csv`: The cleaned dataset generated by the script.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
